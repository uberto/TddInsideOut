This repo is to keep the source code from the _SPA event workshop_ on 4th of September 2013 (https://spa275.eventbrite.co.uk/)

**Creating Objects from Inside Out with TDD and Functional Style**


The goal of this session is to use functional programming practices in TDD to grow objects. Or put in another way to explore the borders between functional and OO programming.

The inspiration of this session came from doing "Test Driven Development As If You Mean It" (http://www.infoq.com/presentations/TDD-as-if-You-Meant-It)" at a code retreat.

I really enjoyed the challenge, so I come up with a slightly different set of rules that reflect more closely my daily work on TDD.

First the usual TDD rules apply:

1) Write exactly one new test. It should be the smallest test which seems to point in the direction of a solution. Run the test to make sure it fails

2) Make the test from (1) pass by writing the least amount of implementation code.

3) Once the tests are green you can (must) refactor to improve the design. 

4) Repeat the process by writing another test (go back to step 1).


Then came my set of rules, influenced by GOOS-style TDD practice.


During refactoring check all the code for these 3 goals:
 - reduce complexity (less calls or less parameters).
 - reduce any form of duplication. 
 - renaming for clarification.
At the end of every refactoring you should have archived at least one of the above, otherwise you must rollback it.


Moreover refactoring steps should follow these rules:

 - (a) You can extract logic from test only to to new static methods without sideeffects on the test class. 
 - (b) You can extract variables and primitives to new immutable objects (Value Object) with only getters and no setters. VO can contains either VO or primitive types but not Entities (see next rule).
 - (c) You can create mutable-state objects (Entity) by combining together existing static methods and local variables. Entities cannot expose directly their inner status, that is they cannot have getters. They can have method that return result of calculation involving their inner state. 
 - (d) Never assign or pass an Entity using its class but always use its interface.
 - (e) Try to use composition over inheritance.
 - (f) Never pass or return null. Use NullObject or TellDontAsk pattern.

In any case each refactoring step should be small and quick. Check often that tests are still green. Remember you are not allowed to do refactoring with red tests!

The goal of the exercise is to explore the border between OO and Functional paradigm.
The resulting design should emerge by the need of minimize the size and number of artefacts needed, rather than following the abstractions imagined by participants.
At the end there should remain no static methods on the test class.


Participants will pair to complete each TDD kata using Cyber Dojo: http://www.cyber-dojo.com/



**Example**

Let's say we want to have an method that returns "flip" and "flop" alternatively each time it's called.

We start with the first test:
```
assertEquals("first a flip", "flip", flipflop());
```		
To make it compile we write _flipflop()_ as a static function inside the Test class.
Once it's green, we don't need any special refactoring so we add a new test.
The second test:
```
assertEquals("first a flip", "flip", flipflop());
assertEquals("then a flop", "flop", flipflop());
```
to make it possible to work (static method, remember?) we add a var:
```
String flip = flipflop("");
assertEquals("first a flip", "flip", flip);
String flop = flipflop(flip);
assertEquals("then a flop", "flop", flop);
```		
Once it's green, we want to simply it, removing the need of an external state, so we create a Entity that keep the state internally:
```	
Flipflop ff = new Flipflop();
assertEquals("first a flip", "flip", ff.switch());
assertEquals("then a flop", "flop", ff.switch());
```
And then we make sure to use an interface to refer it:
```
Switch ff = new Flipflop();
assertEquals("first a flip", "flip", ff.switch());
assertEquals("then a flop", "flop", ff.switch());
```
Now we can add a new test...
